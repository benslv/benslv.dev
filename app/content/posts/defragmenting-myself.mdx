It's bugging me how many different apps and services I currently use to "organise" all of my digital _stuff_. Off the top of my head, I have:

- **Gmail** for emails
- **Todoist** for tasks
- **Instapaper** for any articles I want to read later, or maybe just generic bookmarks if I felt especially wild that day
- **Google Drive** for the majority of my personal files
- **Dropbox** for a subset of other files which, for whatever reason, can't go in Google Drive
- **Obsidian Vault 1** for personal notes
- **Obsidian Vault 2** for work notes
- **Simplenote** for _more_ personal notes (that I wrote before switching to Obsidian on a whim)

I wanted to write about them all partially because it might be interesting but mainly because it will help me lay out my current structure and start thinking about how I can pare it down and improve it.

## Email

Perhaps the most self-contained section I've got in this mess of digital data, my Gmail account is actually pretty organised and I've got at least _some_ kind of plan for where emails need to go, and what can be archived or deleted. It's a not a new concept but I've been trying to think of my inbox as its own to-do list, with emails being items that have to be actioned upon and "completed"â€”this could be as simple as archiving something once I've read it or might require a bit more effort turning it into a Todoist item or something similar. I've found this system quite helpful in staying on top of my emails...and sometimes I even reach âœ¨ inbox zero âœ¨

## Tasks

I would honestly love to have more things to put into a to-do list. Maybe it's just to give me an illusion of feeling productive, because the process of creating projects and tagging items certainly makes me _feel_ like I have my life together.

I find myself bouncing around between the various apps quite a lot, for no other reason than the novelty of starting from scratch. I've tried Todoist, Reminders, Things, Wunderlist (ðŸª¦), TickTick, even Google Tasks, and many others, but nothing ever sticks. I'm destined to switch between all of these until the heat death of the universe so I made an executive decision to switch back to Todoist (which I've used the longest) and _stick with it._

For now.

## Files

Everything else on this list falls under files. I feel like there are a million different ways to organise files and I'm using them all.
