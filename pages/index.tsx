            Hi! I'm Ben, a third year Computer Science student at the University of York, currently

            I recently decided to treat myself to a new website, because my{" "}
            <TextLink to="https://bensilverman.co.uk/">old one</TextLink> was beginning to look a
            little dated, and I've learned a lot about web development in the two years since I
            wrote it!

            I wanted to take this as an opportunity to build something with my favourite new tools
            (namely React and NextJS) that:
          </Text>
          <UnorderedList>
            <Item>looked a lot nicer, with fully responsive layout and styling</Item>
            <Item>
              packed in a lot more functionality, like reusable components, blog posts, and more
            </Item>
          </UnorderedList>
          <Text>
            I might write a little post detailing the full site stack at some point, but I'm mainly
            focussed on actually coding the thing at the moment!

              Recently I discovered a new term I really liked:{" "}
              <b>
                <i>digital gardening.</i>
              </b>
            </Text>
            <Text>
              This lovely, horticultural phrase refers to the act of "cultivating" a website full of
              little snippets, posts and tidbits, letting it naturally evolve over time instead of
              strictly managing and defining its structure.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              I really like the concept of this, so it's not entirely impossible that I'll begin to
              use this site as my own <Emoji emoji="ðŸŒ±" /> digital garden <Emoji emoji="ðŸŒ±" /> of
              sorts, setting it up to hold various different types of{" "}
              <TextLink to="/posts">blog posts</TextLink>, snippets, and pages that I think are
              interesting or useful (either to me or others).
