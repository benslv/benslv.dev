#  Hi, I'm Ben!

I'm a software engineer at [Warner Bros. Discovery](https://wbd.com), currently focused on developing our flagship streaming platform, [Max](https://max.com).

I'm passionate about all things frontend, and love the opportunities it provides to intersect development with design. If I'm not at my computer, you can probably find me at the gym, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92457564-ben-silverman), or playing my saxophone in my local band!

## Experience

Software Engineer II, developing high-performance, cross-platform applications for Max with Solid and LightningJS.
- **Arm Ltd.** (sept. 2020 – sept. 2021)  
Enterprise IT Intern, implementing a component-driven architecture in React for Arm Developer Community, and writing backend Azure policies to introduce new functionality to Arm Account.

## Projects
